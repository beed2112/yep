Yeah, oh yeah!
Findin' my way!
I've been gone so long I've lost count of the years
Well, I sang some sad songs Oh yes, and cried some bad tears
Look out! I'm comin', whoa, whoa Look out! I'm comin', whoa, yeah
I'm runnin', finding my way back home Oh yeah!
Ooh, said I, I'm comin' back to look for you
Ooh, sit down, I'm goin' by the back door
You've done me no right
But you've done me some wrong
Left me lonely each night
While I sing my sad song
I'm findin', I'm findin' my way back home
"Working Man"
I get up at seven, yeah And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin' Yes, I'm workin' all the time
It seems to me I could live my life A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me They call me the working man
They call me the working man I guess that's what I am
I get home at five o'clock And I take myself out a nice, cold beer
Always seem to be wonderin'Why there's nothin' goin' down here
Well, they call me the working man I guess that's what I am
"Anthem"
Know your place in life is where you want to be Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me
Keep on looking forward...no use in looking 'round Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind
We marvel after those who sought The wonders of the world, wonders of the world
Wonders of the world they wrought Live for yourself...there's no one else
More worth living for Begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more
Well, I know they've always told you Selfishness was wrong
Yet it was for me, not you, I came to write this song
"Fly By Night"
Why try? I know why The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
Clear head, new life ahead It's time I was king now -- not just one more pawn
Fly by night, away from here Change my life again
Fly by night, goodbye my dear My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend
Moon rise, thoughtful eyes Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight Leaving behind that empty feeling inside
Start a new chapter Find what I'm after It's changing every day
The change of a season Is enough of a reason To want to get away
Quiet and pensive My thoughts apprehensive The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland Playing a lone hand
My life begins today
"Bastille Day"
There's no bread, let them eat cake
There's no end to what they'll take Flaunt the fruits of noble birth
Wash the salt into the earth But they're marching to Bastille Day
La guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Free the dungeons of the innocent
The king will kneel and let his kingdom rise
Lessons taught but never learned All around us anger burns
Guide the future by the past Long ago the mould was cast
Hear the echoes of the centuries
Power isn't all that money buys
"2112"
And the meek shall inherit the earth...
We've taken care of everything The words you read, the songs you sing The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes
It's one for all and all for one We work together, common sons Never need to wonder how or why
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx Our great computers fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx All the gifts of life are held within our walls
Look around at this world we've made Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man Oh, what a nice, contented world
Let the banners be unfurled Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand
What can this strange device be? When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music What can this thing be that I found?
See how it sings like a sad heart And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain Or notes that fall gently like rain
I can't wait to share this new wonder The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music The Priests praise my name on this night
I know it's most unusual To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle I thought that you should know
Listen to my music And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life I know that it will reach you
Yes, we know, it's nothing new It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways The world is doing fine
Another toy that helped destroy The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim It doesn't fit the plan
I can't believe you're saying These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty Just think what we might do
Listen to my music And hear what it can do There's something here as strong as life I know that it will reach you
Don't annoy us further! We have our work to do
Just think about the average What use have they for you?
Another toy that helped destroy The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim It doesn't fit the Plan!
I wandered home through the silent streets And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night Dream can't you show me the light?
I stand atop a spiral stair An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away Through astral nights, galactic days
I see the works of gifted hands That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise With hungry mind and open eyes
They left our planets long ago The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong To claim the home where they belong
Home to tear the Temples down... Home to change!
The sleep is still in my eyes The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass Not fade like all my dreams...
Just think of what my life might be In a world like I have seen!
I don't think I can carry on Carry on this cold and empty life
My spirits are low in the depths of despair My lifeblood... ...Spills over...
Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
"A Passage To Bangkok"
Our first stop is in Bogota To check Colombian fields
The natives smile and pass along a sample of their yield
Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams Golden Acapulco nights
Then Morocco, and the East Fly by morning light
We're on the train to Bangkok Aboard the Thailand Express
We'll hit the stops along the way We only stop for the best
Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon We burn the midnight oil
The fragrance of Afghanistan Rewards a long day's toil
Pulling into Katmandu Smoke rings fill the air
Perfumed by a Nepal night The Express gets you there
"The Twilight Zone"
A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies Take it off, he's got three eyes
Truth is false and logic lost Now the fourth dimension is crossed...
You have entered the Twilight Zone Beyond this world strange things are known
Use the key, unlock the door See what your fate might have in store...
Come explore your dreams' creation Enter this world of imagination...
You wake up lost in an empty town Wondering why no one else is around
Look up to see a giant boy You've just become his brand new toy
No escape, no place to hide Here where time and space collide
"Something For Nothing"
Waiting for the winds of change To sweep the clouds away
Waiting for the rainbow's end To cast its gold your way
Countless ways You pass the days
Waiting for someone to call And turn your world around
Looking for an answer To the question you have found
Looking for An open door
You don't get something for nothing You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise With the sleep still in your eyes No matter what your dreams might be
What you own is your own kingdom What you do is your own glory
What you love is your own power What you live is your own story
In your head is the answer Let it guide you along
Let your heart be the anchor And the beat of your own song
"Closer To The Heart"
And the men who hold high places Must be the ones who start
To mold a new reality Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
The blacksmith and the artist Reflect it in their art
They forge their creativity Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
Philosophers and ploughmen Each must know his part
To sow a new mentality Closer to the heart
Closer to the heart
You can be the captain I will draw the chart
Sailing into destiny Closer to the heart
"The Trees"
There is unrest in the forest There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight And the oaks ignore their pleas
The trouble with the maples (And they're quite convinced they're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can't help their feelings If they like the way they're made
And they wonder why the maples Can't be happy in their shade
There is trouble in the forest And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream 'Oppression!' And the oaks just shake their heads
So the maples formed a union And demanded equal rights
'The oaks are just too greedy We will make them give us light'
Now there's no more oak oppression For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal By hatchet, axe and saw
"The Spirit Of Radio"
Begin the day with a friendly voice A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive And the magic music makes your morning mood
Off on your way, hit the open road There is magic at your fingers
For the Spirit ever lingers Undemanding contact in your happy solitude
Invisible airwaves crackle with life Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on timeless wavelength Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free
All this machinery making modern music Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted It's really just a question of your honesty, yeah Your honesty
One likes to believe in the freedom of music 
But glittering prizes and endless compromises Shatter the illusion of integrity
Invisible airwaves crackle with life Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on timeless wavelength Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free
"For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall Concert hall 
And echoes with the sound of salesmen...of salesmen...of salesmen."
"Freewill"
There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance
A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance
A planet of play things We dance on the strings
Of powers we cannot perceive 'The stars aren't aligned
Or the gods are malign...' Blame is better to give than receive
You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice 
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear I will choose freewill
There are those who think That they were dealt a losing hand
The cards were stacked against them They weren't born in Lotusland
All preordained A prisoner in chains
A victim of venomous fate Kicked in the face
You can't pray for a place In heaven's unearthly estate
Each of us A cell of awareness
Imperfect and incomplete Genetic blends With uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet
"Tom Sawyer"
A modern day warrior Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer Mean, mean pride
Though his mind is not for rent Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve, a quiet defense Riding out the day's events The river
What you say about his company Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, catch the myth Catch the mystery, catch the drift
The world is, the world is Love and life are deep Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you
And the space he invades He gets by on you
No his mind is not for rent To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent He knows changes aren't permanent But change is
What you say about his company Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit Catch the spirit, catch the spit
Exit the warrior Today's Tom Sawyer He gets high on you
"Red Barchetta"
My uncle has a country place That no one knows about
He says it used to be a farm Before the Motor Law
And on Sundays I elude the eyes And hop the Turbine Freight
To far outside the Wire Where my white-haired uncle waits
Jump to the ground As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline
Run like the wind As excitement shivers up and down my spine
Down in his barn My uncle preserved for me an old machine
For fifty odd years To keep it as new has been his dearest dream
I strip away the old debris That hides a shining car
A brilliant red Barchetta From a better vanished time
I fire up the willing engine Responding with a roar
Tires spitting gravel I commit my weekly crime
Wind In my hair Shifting and drifting Mechanical music Adrenaline surge...
Well-weathered leather Hot metal and oil
The scented country air Sunlight on chrome
The blur of the landscape Every nerve aware
Suddenly ahead of me Across the mountainside
A gleaming alloy air car Shoots towards me, two lanes wide
I spin around with shrieking tires To run the deadly race
Go screaming through the valley As another joins the chase
Drive like the wind Straining the limits of machine and man
Laughing out loud with fear and hope I've got a desperate plan
At the one-lane bridge I leave the giants stranded at the riverside
Race back to the farm To dream with my uncle at the fireside
"Limelight"
Living on a lighted stage Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel In touch with some reality Beyond the gilded cage
Cast in this unlikely role Ill-equipped to act With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers To keep oneself intact
Living in the limelight The universal dream
For those who wish to seem Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation Get on with the fascination
The real relation The underlying theme
Living in a fish eye lens Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie I can't pretend a stranger Is a long-awaited friend
All the world's indeed a stage And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers Each another's audience Outside the gilded cage
"The Camera Eye"
Grim faced and forbidding Their faces closed tight
An angular mass of New Yorkers Pacing in rhythm Race the oncoming night
They chase through the streets of Manhattan Head first humanity
Pause at a light Then flow through the streets of the city
They seem oblivious To a soft spring rain Like an English rain So light, yet endless From a leaden sky
The buildings are lost In their limitless rise My feet catch the pulse And the purposeful stride
I feel the sense of possibilities I feel the wrench of hard realities
The focus is sharp in the city
Mist in the streets of WestminsterWistful and weathered
The pride still prevails Alive in the streets of the city
Are they oblivious To this quality? A quality Of light unique to Every city's streets
Pavements may teem With intense energy But the city is calm In this violent sea
"Witch Hunt"
The night is black Without a moon
The air is thick and still The vigilantes gather on The lonely torch lit hill
Features distorted in the flickering light The faces are twisted and grotesque
Silent and stern in the sweltering night The mob moves like demons possessed
Quiet in conscience, calm in their right Confident their ways are best
The righteous rise With burning eyes Of hatred and ill-will
Madmen fed on fear and lies To beat and burn and kill
They say there are strangers who threaten us In our immigrants and infidels
They say there is strangeness too dangerous In our theaters and bookstore shelves
That those who know what's best for us Must rise and save us from ourselves
Quick to judge Quick to anger Slow to understand Ignorance and prejudice And fear walk hand in hand...
"Vital Signs"
Unstable condition A symptom of life
In mental and environmental change Atmospheric disturbance
The feverish flux Of human interface and interchange
The impulse is pure Sometimes our circuits get shorted
By external interference Signals get crossed
And the balance distorted By internal incoherence
A tired mind become a shape-shifter Everybody need a mood lifter
Everybody need reverse polarity Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form Everybody got to deviate from the norm
An ounce of perception A pound of obscure
Process information at half speed Pause, rewind, replay
Warm memory chip Random sample, hold the one you need
Leave out the fiction The fact is, this friction
Will only be worn by persistence Leave out conditions
Courageous convictions Will drag the dream into existence
A tired mind become a shape-shifter Everybody need a soft filter
Everybody need reverse polarity Everybody got mixed feelings
About the function and the form Everybody got to elevate from the norm...
"Subdivisions"
Sprawling on the fringes of the city In geometric order
An insulated border In between the bright lights And the far unlit unknown
Growing up it all seems so one-sided Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone
In the high school halls In the shopping malls Conform or be cast out
In the basement bars In the backs of cars Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth the unattractive truth But the suburbs have no charms to soothe the restless dreams of youth
Drawn like moths we drift into the city The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action Lit up like a firefly Just to feel the living night
Some will sell their dreams for small desires Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight Somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights...
I'm a wheel, I'm a wheel I can roll, I can feel And you can't stop me turning 
Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sun I can move, I can run But you'll never stop me burning
Come down with fire Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the day, I'm the day I can show you the way And look I'm right beside you
I'm the night, I'm the night I'm the dark and the light With eyes that see inside you
Come down with fire Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name Come and make me holy again
Just look at me and listen I'm the man, the man, give you my hand
I'm the night and the light I'm the black and the white The man on the silver mountain
If you had the time to lose, An open mind and time to choose, Would you care to take a look, Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side.
Can I tempt you, come with me, Be Devil may care, fulfil your dream,
If I said I'd take you there, Would you go, would you be scared?
Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side.
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me, Safe as any soul can be ... honestly, Just let yourself go.
Caught somewhere in time Caught somewhere in time
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, You try to hide your deepest sins,
Of all the things that you've done wrong, And I know where you belong.
Time is always on my side, Time is always on my side.
Make you an offer you can't refuse, You've only got your soul to lose... Eternally... ah ah let yourself go!
Caught now in two minds!
We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound
Uh, Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids on the ground
When it all was over We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race
We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty, cold, and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there With a few red lights, a few old beds We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this Ha, I know, I know we'll never forget
An old man turned 98 He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought, it figures
He waited his whole life to take that flight And as the plane crashed down, he thought "Well, isn't this nice?"
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?
A traffic jam when you're already late
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
And isn't it ironic, don't you think? A little too ironic And, yeah, I really do think
When there's lightning, you know it always brings me down 'Cause it's free and I see that it's me Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic, I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, I lost my hold To the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go? When you've tried, do they hide, deep inside Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture, you're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I We're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning, you know it always brings me down 'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
There's no sight of the morning coming There's no sight of the day
You've been left on your own Like a rainbow
Mmmmhhh mhmm, yeah yeah Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger 
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away Holy diver
Shiny diamonds Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you Look out
Race for the morning You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies Life's a never ending wheel
Holy diver You're the star of the masquerade No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh what's becoming of me
No, no Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away Holy diver, soul survivor
You' re the one whose clean
Holy diver, holy diver
Never come to knew, coming after you
Holy diver
Holy diver, yeah
Alright, get away, get away, get away
Holy diver, holy diver, holy diver mmhhmmm
